# rcfiles
<pr> A collection of configuration files (aka "rc files") for the tools I work with every day.
My tools of the trade I couldn't live as a programmer without are: </pr>
* Vim - there is no text editing without it.
* Zsh - most productive shell used so far.
* Tmux - a good terminal multiplexer makes documentation so much easier.
